What that basically means is we are waiting for members to shape the way the society is going to run. So far we&amp;#8217;ve dabbled in stand-up and radio sketch shows and the chair originally set up the mightily successful comedy nights run by the Students&amp;#8217; Union. (Even if he does say so himself.) Whether you want to write, perform, direct or just enjoy comedy the society will try and provide opportunities to do so. Basically there are opportunities to try your hand at &lt;b&gt;stand-up&lt;/b&gt;, watch new and different comedy, work on projects covering &lt;b&gt;TV, radio&lt;/b&gt; and beyond and maybe, just maybe try and take a show to the &lt;b&gt;Edinburgh Festival Fringe in August 2006&lt;/b&gt;. Or if there is anything else that members want to get involved in (shaving animals won&amp;#8217;t be considered) then we&amp;#8217;ll see what we can do. If you&amp;#8217;re interested in any of that, drop us an email or come and see us at Freshers&amp;#8217; Fair and you could be at the start of something vaguely interesting.
