    <title>The Yorker: Ticket #27: Apache Config</title>
    <link>http://dev2.theyorker.co.uk/trac/ticket/27</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
I've just tried to add an apache virtual host for demo.dev.theyorker.co.uk but for some reason it wasn't working and I was being sent to the default /var/www instead (which so happens to redirect to www.theyorker.co.uk).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
However, changing it to z.dev.theyorker.co.uk works so I'm guessing one of the virtual hosts that gets included later overrides some of the settings. I haven't got much time atm so is there any chance someone could take a look to see if anything weird is going on?
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
Not sure if this is related, but just remembered that after I put the new site live on the Friday of Roses, the javascript files weren't being picked up. When I checked the access log it was trying to get them from /usr/share/. As a temp fix I copied them there to get it working but I completely forgot about it until now. Whilst you are looking at the above check to see if something is redirecting /javascript/ requests which we don't know about. Thanks!
&lt;/p&gt;

fixed /usr/share javascript problem. it was because of /etc/apache2/conf.d/javascript-common.conf which aliases /javascript to /usr/share so trac can access jquery
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
moved the alias into dev.theyorker.co.uk config file and it now only applies to that site
&lt;/p&gt;

            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;status&lt;/strong&gt;
                changed from &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;closed&lt;/em&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
            &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;resolution&lt;/strong&gt;
                set to &lt;em&gt;fixed&lt;/em&gt;
            &lt;/li&gt;
          &lt;/ul&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;
i was curious so i tried changing z.dev back to demo.dev and it now appears to work fine.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
i'm guessing it was a caching issue
&lt;/p&gt;
