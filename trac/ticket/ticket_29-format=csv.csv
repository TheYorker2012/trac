29,Missing Images,webmaster,webmaster,"I was just checking that my session changes hadn't caused any problems, and i noticed in the error log that public_html/images/prototype/news/rose_lancashire.png, and rose_draw.png were missing, referred from:
http://www.theyorker.co.uk/news/generalsport/1693

Also rss-itunes.jpg is missing but i'm not sure where that was referred from.

Thought I'd better tell you in case you didn't already know.

Cheers
