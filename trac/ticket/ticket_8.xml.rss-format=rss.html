    <title>The Yorker: Ticket #8: Crossword publishing and expiry safety</title>
    <link>http://dev2.theyorker.co.uk/trac/ticket/8</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
transitions with publication and expiration are currently reactive based on easily modifiable properties. it should be safer.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
i propose that any potentially dangerous transitions require specific permissions, and are warned about where the user must confirm the change.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
* a change that will publish the crossword immediately
* a change that will expire the crossword immediately
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
things to think about
* should a writer be able to get crossword published straight away by setting 100% when all else is ready? at the moment this isn't a problem, but perhaps should bear in mind
&lt;/p&gt;
