    <title>The Yorker: Ticket #39: Facebook style IRC chat bar for office users</title>
    <link>http://dev2.theyorker.co.uk/trac/ticket/39</link>
    <description>&lt;p&gt;
a bit of fun
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
this is actually working in irc branch
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
however i need to make sure it isn't going to have adverse effects on the server such as by using up all apache's worker threads when there are lots of people logged in.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
also we need to be sure that we're allowed to have irc client software (which seems to be prohibited on the server).
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
we could work around by having local irc server (no net traffic), or using something other than irc (jabber or our own chat thing).
&lt;/p&gt;
