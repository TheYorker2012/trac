31	Investigate difficulty of having crosswords as facebook app	james_hogan	james_hogan	"it would be great to be able to play the crosswords on facebook by way of a facebook app.

because the names are known, they should be usable in the leaderboard.

general ideas
 * play in facebook without logging in to the yorker, using fbjs etc
 * when win, add name, and send notification to say you won whatever position
 * alternatively to prevent saturation by non-yorkies, require yorker login to win, or linking of facebook account with yorker account"	task	new	minor		Crosswords
