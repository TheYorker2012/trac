2	Disallow crossword winning by anybody with access to crossword / office	james_hogan	james_hogan	"It remains to be decided where to draw the line.

it would be possible to prevent access to anybody who can access that particular crossword (authors + anyone who can access other people's crosswords)

may be safer to prevent anybody with crossword access from using it, or even all officers (although that may not be appropriate)

still allow them to play and complete the crossword, but don't add a winner position for them.

it must also tell them that they were not added for that reason."	defect	new	major		Crosswords
