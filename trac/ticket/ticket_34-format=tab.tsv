34	Crossword office permit writer/editor workflow	james_hogan	james_hogan	"either at some time in the future more people might offer to write crosswords, or a proof reader may be required

some ideas

 * proof readers can be assigned (based on some permission)
 * proof readers can ""sign off"" a crossword and permit corrections
 * proof readers can modify the crossword
 * private comment thread per crossword is pretty important for feedback
 * proof readers can ""reject"" a crossword and the writer gets informed
 * save each version of crossword in same way as public side
 * differences can be seen easily (which clues have changed etc)
 * only signed off version published"	functionality	new	minor		Crosswords
