27,Apache Config,webmaster,ado,"I've just tried to add an apache virtual host for demo.dev.theyorker.co.uk but for some reason it wasn't working and I was being sent to the default /var/www instead (which so happens to redirect to www.theyorker.co.uk).

However, changing it to z.dev.theyorker.co.uk works so I'm guessing one of the virtual hosts that gets included later overrides some of the settings. I haven't got much time atm so is there any chance someone could take a look to see if anything weird is going on?

Not sure if this is related, but just remembered that after I put the new site live on the Friday of Roses, the javascript files weren't being picked up. When I checked the access log it was trying to get them from /usr/share/. As a temp fix I copied them there to get it working but I completely forgot about it until now. Whilst you are looking at the above check to see if something is redirecting /javascript/ requests which we don't know about. Thanks!",defect,closed,minor,,General,fixed,,james_hogan@â€¦
