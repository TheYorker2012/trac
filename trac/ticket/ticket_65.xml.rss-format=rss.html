    <title>The Yorker: Ticket #65: improve useability of calendar</title>

&lt;p&gt;
 Just to see what I mean about UI, try getting 3 events onto the music gigs
 box (e.g. from &lt;a class="ext-link" href="http://www.fibbers.co.uk/fibbers/whatson.cfm"&gt;&lt;span class="icon"&gt;http://www.fibbers.co.uk/fibbers/whatson.cfm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), and see how
 many clicks it takes. maybe we should be able to publish events as they are
 created, and have a "recurring" or "advanced" tick box that hides all the
 complexities of multiple occurrences unless they are needed? That would
 reduce it a bit.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
