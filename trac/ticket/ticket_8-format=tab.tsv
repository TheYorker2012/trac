8	Crossword publishing and expiry safety	james_hogan	james_hogan	"transitions with publication and expiration are currently reactive based on easily modifiable properties. it should be safer.

i propose that any potentially dangerous transitions require specific permissions, and are warned about where the user must confirm the change.

* a change that will publish the crossword immediately
* a change that will expire the crossword immediately

things to think about
* should a writer be able to get crossword published straight away by setting 100% when all else is ready? at the moment this isn't a problem, but perhaps should bear in mind"	defect	new	major		Crosswords
